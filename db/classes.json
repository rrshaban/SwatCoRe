We will study the functions and contexts of calligraphic inscriptions among a rich range of material texts, such as animal bones, bronze vessels, stone stelae, mountain cliffs, and various paper-based formats. In addition to analyzing the development and circulation of calligraphic styles within East Asia and celebrated works of individual calligraphers, we will explore how calligraphy conveys meaning and how it has been used as a powerful tool for cultural and political commentary.

In this course, we will examine the ideas behind the initial creation of national parks and explore the global spread of these ideas through the historical and contemporary creation of parks in other countries. As we examine the origin of the idea for parks, we will also consider the human costs that have been associated with their creation. Ultimately, the class offers a critical exploration of theories and themes related to nature, political economy, and culture-themes that fundamentally underlie the relationship between society and environment.

In addition to plays by Aristophanes, Plautus, and Terence, and satirical poetry by Archilochus, Hipponax, Horace, and Juvenal, we will also explore the very idea of the \u201corigins of comedy\u201d from diverse perspectives. Questions about what motivates satirists to attack the behavior of their contemporaries and speculation about the quasi-religious roots of mockery have been fertile and contested areas of inquiry for centuries. We will read numerous thinkers (ancient and modern) who have proposed theories of the origins of comedy, including Aristotle, Freud, Bakhtin, Bergson, and Francis Cornford. And we will also encounter more recent comedians\u2019 reflections on their own birth and origins, including performers such as Richard Pryor, Howard Stern, Tina Fey, Louis CK, Sarah Silverman, Jon Stewart, and Lenny Bruce.

Screenings of films by major Italian and Anglophone filmmakers, including Pastrone, DeMille, Rossellini, Visconti, Wyler, Pasolini, Fellini, Virz\u00ec, and other major directors.

He devoted his entire life to literature, as a writer but also as an irreverent and subversive reader. None of his lines, none of his declarations happened inadvertently. Hated or held dear, Borges is incessantly quoted. The objective of this course is to read Borges from the double perspective required by his worldwide fame: as a universal writer who transcends national borders, but also as a writer that seeks to reinvent the history and the traditions of his own country, Argentina.

While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city\u2019s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe-most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city\u2019s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson\u2019s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson\u2019s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson\u2019s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive \u201calternative\u201d energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?

We will investigate: Moli\u00e8re\u2019s political relationship with Louis XIV at Versailles, the discourse of early modern feminism of the pr\u00e9cieuses and the femmes savantes; the critique of religious hypocrisy, and the influence of early modern notions of anthropology, notably medicine, on Moli\u00e8re\u2019s notions of selfhood. These aspects will be brought forward through close attention to the poetics of comedy and the art of the comedian. ",

This course will examine the historical development of gendered and patriarchal readings of Islamic legal, historical, and scriptural texts. Particular attention will be given to both the premodern and modern strategies employed by women to subvert these exclusionary forms of interpretation and to ensure more egalitarian outcomes for themselves in the public sphere. Topics discussed include female piety, marriage and divorce, motherhood, polygamy, sex and desire, honor and shame, same-sex sexuality, and the role of women in the transmission of knowledge. ",

We will focus primarily on the uses of erotic love (along with the body and the \u201cpassions\u201d) in religious discourse- in poetry, commentary, and prose narratives-the many ways passionate love and/or sexuality are used cross-culturally to describe the relationship between the human and the divine. We will also explore other emotions and attitudes evoked by the word love: devotion, affection, friendship, \u201ccharity\u201d (caritas), parental love, and the tensions of these forms of \u201clove\u201d with erotic love. Along with primary texts from the Greek, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, secular troubadour, and Hindu traditions, we will explore the theoretical writings of Martha Nussbaum, Peter Brown, David Halperin, Julia Kristeva, David Biale, Daniel Boyarin, Caroline Walker Bynum, Henry Corbin, Michael Sells, A.K. Ramanujan, Wendy Doniger, David Shulman, and Margaret Trawick. Such a thematic treatment of what we in the English-speaking West call \u201clove\u201d brings to the fore many important theoretical questions concerning the cultural construction of emotions, particular love and \u201cennobling virtues,\u201d the erotic life, the body, and religion.

The starting point of the course is Machiavelli\u2019s novel \u201cscience\u201d of statecraft, which identified the state as the focal point of political activity, and announced that a good politician must be prepared to act immorally, or even love his city more than his soul. In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B.

How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on\u00a0conflict and instability across the region. We will\u00a0trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management.

Special attention is given to ideology and political Islam, nationalism, the educational system, and the concepts of post-Islamism and social non-movements, particularly since the Green Movement and Arab Spring.

The objective of this course is to read Borges from the double perspective required by his worldwide fame: as a universal writer who transcends national borders, but also as a writer that seeks to reinvent the history and the traditions of his own country, Argentina.

Over time less common uses tend to semantically bleach, so that historical taboo terms can be used without hint of vulgarity or rudeness. These less common uses can fall together with slang in exhibiting linguistic behavior unique within that language, at the word level and the phrase and sentence level, behavior that is telling with respect to linguistic theory.

It will focus on issues in Islamic legal theory, methodology, constitutional law, personal law, and family law that have had the greatest relevance to our contemporary world. This course functions as a basic introduction to the Islamic legal system in its pre-modern and contemporary forms. The course will also provide comparative discussion of the contrasts between Islamic legal theory and positive law and European and American legal and constitutional thought. ",

    "description": "This seminar will explore religious literature, bodily practices, and social behaviors associated with the performance of secrecy in various geographical, historical, and political contexts. Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion? Is it necessary that what one wishes to conceal is inherently negative, pernicious or even heretical? ",

Central questions include: How do we define crises in the contemporary Middle East/North Africa region? How does the nature of the crisis (political, economic, social, and environmental) impact communities differently? How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on\u00a0conflict and instability across the region. We will\u00a0trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management. By understanding crises through the theoretical prism of human security frameworks, we will ascertain the prospects for democratization, development, pluralism, and peace in the region. ",

    "description": "In Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies, we learn that peace and conflict are not mutually exclusive. To paraphrase Conrad Brunk, the goal of peace and conflict studies is to better understand conflict in order to find nonviolent ways of turning unjust relationships into more just ones. We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach with significant contributions from the social sciences. U.S.-based social justice movements, such as the struggle for racial equality, and global movements, such as nonviolent activism in Israel/Palestine, and the struggle for climate justice around the world, will serve as case studies. \u00a0 ",

Celebrations, condemnations, as well as obituaries of U.S. hegemony have repeatedly been written. At the same time, nuclear weapons and the economic interdependence have radically reduced the prospects for war between great powers. Does the U.S.A. stand as the sole great power? Is the European Union simply an enormous market with a soft spot for multilateralism, or does the worldviews it puts forward and the international relations it fosters rival the U.S. way? To what extent does the Chinese agenda at multilateral institutions conflict with that of the U.S.A.\u2019s and the E.U.\u2019s?

Is it simply a tool to help us find the best means to our ends, to break down complex problems into understandable parts? Or is reason always the servant of powerful interests (our own or those of others) and thus inevitably a tool of the powerful to manipulate the weak? In this sense, are policy analysts, skilled at using reason to do cost-benefit calculations, simply hired guns, serving the interest of the powerful?

In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination.

Celebrations, condemnations, as well as obituaries of U.S. hegemony have repeatedly been written. At the same time, nuclear weapons and the economic interdependence have radically reduced the prospects for war between great powers. Does the U.S.A. stand as the sole great power? Is the European Union simply an enormous market with a soft spot for multilateralism, or does the worldviews it puts forward and the international relations it fosters rival the U.S. way? To what extent does the Chinese agenda at multilateral institutions conflict with that of the U.S.A.\u2019s and the E.U.\u2019s? In answering these questions and others, some of the issues that the course addresses are: changing meanings of \u201cgreat power\u201d and \u201crivalry\u201d; historical overview of rivalry; trade disputes between the U.S.A., E.U., and China at the World Trade Organization; relations between these three powers at other international institutions, particularly the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund; foreign aid policies of the U.S.A., the E.U., and China; the implications of the rise of Brazil, Russia, and India for world politics.

Special attention is given to ideology and political Islam, nationalism, the educational system, and the concepts of post-Islamism and social non-movements, particularly since the Green Movement and Arab Spring.

Politicians and pundits on both the left and right have equated Islam with violence and terrorism despite the small minority of self-professed Muslims who carry out such attacks. This perception has called into question Islam\u2019s compatibility with Western values and ways of life. Such discussions raise new questions about the limits of free speech, the challenges of multiculturalism, women\u2019s rights, gender equality, and sexuality, as well as the visibility of religion in the public sphere. This class offers a critical survey of contemporary debates on Islam in the West and examines the diversity of lived experiences of Western Muslims in Europe and the United States. It focuses on the ways in which ethnic, religious, and racial minorities are incorporated into and/or excluded from processes of nation formation. We will consider how notions of belonging, citizenship, and otherness have been defined in particular locales, how they are socialized through a variety of institutional contexts, and how they change over time. Our readings draw from a broad range of academic disciplines and cover topical issues such as the headscarf affair, cartoon controversies, and rising Islamophobia.

In turn, it examines how various religious worldviews can aid the development of an earth-centered philosophy of life. The thesis of this course is that the environment crisis, at its core, is a spiritual crisis because it is human beings\u2019 deep ecocidal dispositions toward nature that are the cause of the earth\u2019s continued degradation. Course topics include ecological thought in Western philosophy, theology, and biblical studies; the role of Asian religious thought in forging an ecological worldview; the value of American nature writings for environmental awareness, including both Euro-American and Amerindian literatures; the public policy debates concerning vegetarianism and the antitoxics movement; and the contemporary relevance of ecofeminism, deep ecology, Neopaganism, and wilderness activism. In addition to writing assignments, there will be occasional contemplative practicums, journaling exercises, and a community-based learning component. ",

    "description": "This seminar will examine the concept of evil, as it appears in a variety of religious, philosophical, psychological and literary texts and their cultural contexts. Variably personified as malevolent celestial beings-whether playful or vengeful figures like Beelzebul, Kali, Mara, Ravana, Satan, etc.-evil has been tied to ethics. In South and East Asian traditions evil is an effect of the law of karma (literally, \u201caction\u201d). In Buddhism, evil appears because of ignorance or illusion, which mistakes our \u2018self\u2019 and the world to be made up of independent and permanent \u201cthings.\u201d In the Christian West, evil was seen as a necessary by-product of a \u201cfree will\u201d whose corruption or depravity must be acknowledged to achieve any human goodness. Framed philosophically, as a value judgment that has historically been assigned to intentionally harmful actions, misfortune, or even natural disasters such as the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, evil came to be problematized in the West in the question: \u201cHow could a benevolent God allow the innocent to suffer?\u201d We will survey the depth of that question, but also ask: Is this formulation of \u201cthe problem of evil\u201d uniquely Western in its assumption that a god must be absolutely good? In addition, we will approach the concept of evil psychologically, by examining demonic possession and exorcism, as well as recurring complicity in mass atrocities, which will lead us to consider the theory of \u201cthe scapegoat,\u201d and the very different idea that evil now is \u201cbanal,\u201d as unthinking people become part of the machinery of modern power.\u00a0 ",

The course will focus on both primary texts in translation (religious poetry and prose narratives in epic and medieval Sanskrit, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Hindi, Pali, Sinhala, Sindhi, and Urdu) as well as pertinent secondary literature on the poetry and poetics of religious devotion. We will also pay close attention to specific literary forms, genres, and regional styles, as well as the performance (music and dance) and hagiographical traditions that frame the poems of Hindu saint-poets, Buddhist monks, and Muslim mystics. Along with a chronological and geographical focus, the seminar will be organized around major themes such as popular/vernacular and \u201celite\u201d traditions; the performance and ritual contexts of religious poetry; the place of the body in religious emotion; love, karma, caste, and family identity; asceticism and eroticism; gender and power; renunciation and family obligations.

We will focus primarily on the uses of erotic love (along with the body and the \u201cpassions\u201d) in religious discourse- in poetry, commentary, and prose narratives-the many ways passionate love and/or sexuality are used cross-culturally to describe the relationship between the human and the divine. We will also explore other emotions and attitudes evoked by the word love: devotion, affection, friendship, \u201ccharity\u201d (caritas), parental love, and the tensions of these forms of \u201clove\u201d with erotic love. Along with primary texts from the Greek, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, secular troubadour, and Hindu traditions, we will explore the theoretical writings of Martha Nussbaum, Peter Brown, David Halperin, Julia Kristeva, David Biale, Daniel Boyarin, Caroline Walker Bynum, Henry Corbin, Michael Sells, A.K. Ramanujan, Wendy Doniger, David Shulman, and Margaret Trawick. Such a thematic treatment of what we in the English-speaking West call \u201clove\u201d brings to the fore many important theoretical questions concerning the cultural construction of emotions, particular love and \u201cennobling virtues,\u201d the erotic life, the body, and religion.

Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion? Is it necessary that what one wishes to conceal is inherently negative, pernicious or even heretical? ",

We will also examine a range of case studies, from the birth of Western Christian\u00a0humanitarian\u00a0missions in colonial contexts to humanitarian\u00a0interventions (e.g. military, food-based assistance, natural disaster relief, post-conflict reconstruction) today. The geographic scope of this seminar will encompass North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East/North Africa, East Asia, and South\u00a0Asia. We will consider, for instance, how anthropologists have examined relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in\u00a0New\u00a0Orleans. What social science scholarship has been produced on mental health interventions after political and natural crises in Haiti? How are victims of torture at the hands of the Indian military supported by international organizations in Kashmir? What is the nature of global Islamic\u00a0humanitarianism\u00a0today? How are local national staff employed by international organizations shaping\u00a0humanitarian\u00a0approaches to gender-based violence in Colombia? These are among the many questions we will address over the course of the semester. ",

This seminar will therefore examine the defining features of the current capitalist milieu through the lens of comparative ethnography. Combining classic theoretical readings on the structure and development of capitalism with concrete ethnographic studies, we will analyze a broad sample of the many guises under which capital travels across political, economic, and cultural borders. These analyses will then enable us to approach the more pressing question of how individual actors can and do contribute to the transformation of the global cultural economy. ",

In this class, we look at urban ethnographies (texts and films) through space and examine how the representation of the city has changed over time. These ethnographies are conducted in Western cities such as New York, London, and Paris as well as cities in other parts of the world such as Cairo, Casablanca, Bombay, S\u00e3o Paolo, and Shanghai. We read these ethnographies to (1) discuss different techniques and approaches used to study urban cultures and identities, (2) examine how the collection of data relates to anthropological theories and methods, and (3) explore how research in cities shapes the field of cultural anthropology. In our discussions, we also explore important urban problems such as poverty, gangs, violence, and homelessness. ",

While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city\u2019s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe-most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city\u2019s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson\u2019s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson\u2019s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson\u2019s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive \u201calternative\u201d energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?

    "description": "Over decades millions of workers struggled together, often at great risk and against great odds and repression, to build the U.S. labor movement. In the process they carved out a place of dignity, prosperity, and political voice for workers at the bottom of the economic ladder. They created a path of economic mobility for minorities, women and immigrants. They provided a counterweight for the average citizen against the increasingly concentrated power and influence of modern capitalism\u2019s most fortunate. Because the labor movement empowers the weak it has always been embattled and for decades now it has been in decline. While it contributed some to its own demise, capitalists have systematically attacked the labor movement with a carefully planned and well-funded hegemonic project that has directly challenged it, delegitimized it and legally hamstrung it. The consequences for workers and our society have been terrible. The labor movement is no longer a hedge against economic inequality and over the last several decades an ever-increasing share of the benefits of economic growth go to the top 1% of Americans while wages stagnate or decline for most Americans. Without labor our political discourse is bereft of any meaningful discussion of alternative to the corporate-sponsored neo-liberal ideology of free-markets and deregulation. The traditional avenues of a strong labor movement-the less-educated, immigrants, women, Latinos, and African-Americans-are closing. Soon, if things don\u2019t change, there will be no labor movement to speak of. No other institution in U.S. history has been able to do what the labor movement has done for the average person. What could revitalize it? What, if anything, could replace it? This course will use theories of politics, economics, class and social movements to understand the rise and decline of the labor movement and why it was so critical in determining economic inequality.

Issues to be discussed include the relation between national identity, ideology and political discourse, the politics of representation in terms of race, gender and sexuality, exile and diaspora, the role of the intellectual, the balance between ethics and aesthetics, and the current period of political and economic transition.

Finally, each student will have the opportunity to test our principles of work through one scene with a partner, no longer than ten minutes, to be assigned by the instructor. This scene will be performed in front of the class. ",
