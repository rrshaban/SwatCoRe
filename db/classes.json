Turning away from traditional approaches to Renaissance art, which are often defined by chronological or geographical boundaries, we will concentrate on four issues central to the artistic culture of the period: the artist as individual genius, technologies of artistic production (oil painting, printmaking), courtly art and patronage, and the arts of exploration (maps, cross-cultural influence). In each of these four sections, we will explore artworks from multiple geographies, including northern and southern Europe, couching the major artists and artworks of the Italian and Northern Renaissance within conceptual frameworks that highlight their interconnected nature and their relationship with other people, places, and movements.",

This period of political and cultural ascendance, which saw the Spanish empire blossom across the Atlantic and Asia, gave rise to many of Spain\u2019s greatest cultural achievements. This course examines the artworks and artists that made this period special, as well as the patrons and political realities underpinning the period\u2019s achievements. We will focus, in particular, on painters such as El Greco, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, and Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, connecting their artistic production to artistic movements throughout Europe and to the broader trends of the baroque. We will also explore the remarkable corpus of polychrome sculpture produced by sculptors such as Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1es during the period, examining their role in religious rituals and processions. Lastly, we will examine the major architectural trends and monuments from the period, including the Escorial and several baroque cathedrals. This survey of painting, sculpture, and architecture from the period will help students understand the ideas and values underpinning this singular moment in artistic history, as well as the place of Spanish golden age art within a broader European and global context.",

This course posits improvisation-that is, encountering and working around borders while reacting to the impeding and facilitating possibilities they present-as a necessary and highly potent condition of cultural liminality. Accordingly, this course suggests that musical and cultural improvisatory performances can carve out discursive space within the socio-political systems that marginalize these communities. Drawing on the methodologies and scholarship of social sciences and the performing arts, we will explore this dynamic through interdisciplinary case studies in the Trans-Atlantic African Diaspora, with attention to local interpretations of global jazz culture and fusions of local music with jazz performance aesthetics. Also, the course will critically engage with the politics of collective identity, exploring how communities drawn together through a common genre marker or diasporic affiliation can themselves reproduce marginalizing hierarchies.",

The popular genre of German (short) prose fiction, characterized by thematic diversity and narrative innovation, has been flourishing in various literary movements from Goethe to the present time. In this course, we will read a great variety of prose fiction (Erz\u00e4hlungen, Geschichten, Novellen), from the late 18th century onward, and examine the changing narrative forms and thematic preoccupations found in these texts. Authors include: E.T.A. Hoffmann, Eichendorff, Kleist, B\u00fcchner, Keller, Gotthelf, Droste-H\u00fclshoff, Stifter, Hebbel, Grillparzer, \u00a0Kafka, Koeppen, Lenz, Bachmann, Hildesheimer, B\u00f6ll, Aichinger, Lenz, and others.",

A major focus of the course is how accounting provides information to various user groups so that they can make more informed decisions. In particular, students will learn the steps in the accounting cycle leading up to the preparation and analysis of corporate financial statements. Students are also exposed to some of the fundamental differences between federal tax rules and external financial reporting requirements and are made aware of the organizations that influence and contribute to the body of knowledge in financial accounting. Finally, ethical issues that may be confronted by the accountant are also discussed throughout the course.",

In this course, we will examine the ideas behind the initial creation of national parks and explore the global spread of these ideas through the historical and contemporary creation of parks in other countries. As we examine the origin of the idea for parks, we will also consider the human costs that have been associated with their creation. Ultimately, the class offers a critical exploration of theories and themes related to nature, political economy, and culture-themes that fundamentally underlie the relationship between society and environment.",

With the disappearance of languages, cultural knowledge (including entire technologies such as ethnopharmacology) is often lost, leading to a decrease in humans\u2019 ability to manage the natural environment. Language endangerment thus proves relevant to questions of the language/ecology interface, ethnoecology, and cultural survival. The seminar also addresses the ethics of fieldwork and dissemination of traditional knowledge in the Internet age.",

While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city\u2019s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe-most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city\u2019s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson\u2019s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson\u2019s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson\u2019s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive \u201calternative\u201d energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?",

This course studies the films of post-Franco Spain, which are at once bursting with themes of liberation yet haunted by the ghosts of its recent past. We will chart the development of Spanish culture through the examination and interpretation of 1990s and 2000s Spanish films. Students will become familiar with important Spanish topics such as national stereotypes, European integration, violence, race, sexual identities, and gender relations, as well as relevant concepts in Film Studies such as cinematic genre, gaze theory, and spectatorship.",

The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination.

    "description": "This seminar will explore religious literature, bodily practices, and social behaviors associated with the performance of secrecy in various geographical, historical, and political contexts. Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion? Is it necessary that what one wishes to conceal is inherently negative, pernicious or even heretical?",

To better understand the cultural and social significance of the objects we study, we will look to a variety of disciplinary approaches including art history, archeology, anthropology, ethnography. We will examine how artworks from the ancient Americas reflected, supported, and actively shaped the worldview of the people who created and used them. In addition, the class will briefly examine the significance of pre-Columbian art in contemporary society, including the topics of cultural nationalism, looting, and the politics of collecting pre-Columbian art.",

This leads to a split into separate daughter languages, which often end up being mutually incomprehensible. The question is, how is it possible to figure out and reconstruct the changes and splits that occurred in the distant past in languages that are no longer spoken and were perhaps never recorded?

In this course, students will explore this drive through development of their own constructed languages, guided by rigorous study of the typology of patterns observed in real human languages. Topics to be covered include phoneme inventories, phonological rules, morphological classification, syntactic structure, language change over time, dialectal variation, and writing systems. Students will also apply their knowledge of linguistic typology to critically assess the design of existing constructed languages such as Esperanto and Klingon.",

With the disappearance of languages, cultural knowledge (including entire technologies such as ethnopharmacology) is often lost, leading to a decrease in humans\u2019 ability to manage the natural environment. Language endangerment thus proves relevant to questions of the language/ecology interface, ethnoecology, and cultural survival.

    "description": "This seminar will explore religious literature, bodily practices, and social behaviors associated with the performance of secrecy in various geographical, historical, and political contexts. Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion? Is it necessary that what one wishes to conceal is inherently negative, pernicious or even heretical?",

Central questions include: How do we define crises in the contemporary Middle East/North Africa region? How does the nature of the crisis (political, economic, social, and environmental) impact communities differently? How are grassroots actors, civil society institutions, states, and international organizations responding to these challenges in their nation-states and across borders? What transnational networks of solidarity have linked the Middle East to other regions across the globe? For instance, this course will examine the consequences of environmental degradation and escalating food prices on\u00a0conflict and instability across the region. We will also trace the origins of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and social movements calling for rights and reforms on one hand and the rise of fundamentalism and terrorism (i.e. Al-Qaeda and ISIS) on the other hand. Furthermore, the course will explore crises such as contemporary Syria, and how local and international interventions aimed at reversing the marginalization of-and threats against-minority populations (ethnic, religious, gender, sexuality, ability) have come to constitute a realm of crisis management. By understanding crises through the theoretical prism of human security frameworks, we will ascertain the prospects for democratization, development, pluralism, and peace in the region.",

To paraphrase Conrad Brunk, the goal of peace and conflict studies is to better understand conflict in order to find nonviolent ways of turning unjust relationships into more just ones. We examine both the prevalence of coercive and non-peaceful means of conducting conflict as well as the development of nonviolent alternatives, locally and globally, through institutions and at the grassroots. The latter include nonviolent collective action, mediation, peacekeeping, and conflict transformation work. Several theoretical and philosophical lenses will be used to explore cultural and psychological dispositions, conflict in human relations, and conceptualizations of peace. The course will take an interdisciplinary approach with significant contributions from the social sciences. U.S.-based social justice movements, such as the struggle for racial equality, and global movements, such as nonviolent activism in Israel/Palestine, and the struggle for climate justice around the world, will serve as case studies.",

Through the examination of a variety of experiences, genres, and perspectives, we will ask questions like: How do narratives of war contribute to the formation of national, local, and Arab identities? How has the experience of war impacted understandings of religion, masculinity, gender, and domestic violence? We will identify common themes and images, and also investigate how these patterns change and develop in different spatial and temporal contexts.",

Celebrations, condemnations, as well as obituaries of U.S. hegemony have repeatedly been written. At the same time, nuclear weapons and the economic interdependence have radically reduced the prospects for war between great powers. Does the U.S.A. stand as the sole great power? Is the European Union simply an enormous market with a soft spot for multilateralism, or does the worldviews it puts forward and the international relations it fosters rival the U.S. way? To what extent does the Chinese agenda at multilateral institutions conflict with that of the U.S.A.\u2019s and the E.U.\u2019s?

Do we need to be powerful in order to be happy, and, if so, what kind of power do we need? What do we mean by reason? Is it a neutral capacity- silent about ends or values? Is it simply a tool to help us find the best means to our ends, to break down complex problems into understandable parts? Or is reason always the servant of powerful interests (our own or those of others) and thus inevitably a tool of the powerful to manipulate the weak? In this sense, are policy analysts, skilled at using reason to do cost-benefit calculations, simply hired guns, serving the interest of the powerful? Or is reason actually an integral part of the daily moral choices we make, as Aristotle argued when he wrote about practical wisdom (",

In other words, we begin with the thought of politics as a distinct sphere of activity, centered around the state, and separable from other spheres such as morality and religion. The problem of the modern state and the relationship of the political to other domains of life will guide our exploration of the fundamental concepts and debates of modern political thought. Other themes we will discuss include secularism and toleration, absolutist and popular sovereignty, constitutionalism and individual rights, theories of war and colonialism, and the relationship between social and political forms of domination. Authors include Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft, Karl Marx, Max Weber and W.E.B.

It will be studied from the perspectives of multiple disciplines, including cosmology, evolution and microbiology, basic cognitive science, philosophy, political theory, transpersonal and social psychology, and the spiritual practices of many traditions. The largest dimensions of consciousness and suffering invoke our most fundamental conceptions of time and space. Opening up those dimensions, vertically and horizontally, we begin to expand our sense of identity, both in terms of a temporal existence that can encompass many lifetimes, and in terms of shattering the myth of separation that encapsulates us as distinct, individual, autonomous beings. Expanding our sense of who we are, and of how we have become who we are, enables us to experience ourselves as an evolving species \u2013living nodes in a living web of life that generates and regenerates all sentient beings, a living earth and universe.

Celebrations, condemnations, as well as obituaries of U.S. hegemony have repeatedly been written. At the same time, nuclear weapons and the economic interdependence have radically reduced the prospects for war between great powers. Does the U.S.A. stand as the sole great power? Is the European Union simply an enormous market with a soft spot for multilateralism, or does the worldviews it puts forward and the international relations it fosters rival the U.S. way? To what extent does the Chinese agenda at multilateral institutions conflict with that of the U.S.A.\u2019s and the E.U.\u2019s?

We will study the different definition, causes, and effects of revolutions, as well as the distinction between revolutions and other forms of social movements. Students will be challenged to explain how we know when a revolution is complete-what happens after the storming of the palace?-as well as the reasons why certain revolutions fail while others succeed. Although the course considers a broad scope of political uprisings, ranging from the \u201ccolored revolutions\u201d of the post-Communist to the Occupy Wall Street movement, special attention will be paid to the French, Russian, Mexican, Chinese, Cuban, and Iranian revolutions.",

This course examines a range of fresh water issues, comparing China and the U.S. Topics include dams and large-scale water projects (e.g., rerouting rivers); water pollution; groundwater depletion; industrial water use (e.g., for hydrofracking); impact of agricultural practices; urban storm water management; wetlands conservation; desertification; desalination. In the U.S. context especially, issues of water rights regimes and property rights, privatization, and commodification of water will receive attention. Which claims upon fresh water resources come first? What role do governments, transnational organizations, corporations, NGOs, and grassroots citizens\u2019 movements play in these water decisions?

In this course, we ask several fundamental questions about the psychology of language: How do children acquire it so quickly and accurately? How do we understand and produce it, seemingly without effort? What are its biological underpinnings? What is the relationship between language and thought? How did language evolve? And to what extent is the capacity for language \u201cbuilt in\u201d (genetically) versus \u201cbuilt up\u201d (by experience)?",

We will focus primarily on the uses of erotic love (along with the body and the \u201cpassions\u201d) in religious discourse- in poetry, commentary, and prose narratives-the many ways passionate love and/or sexuality are used cross-culturally to describe the relationship between the human and the divine. We will also explore other emotions and attitudes evoked by the word love: devotion, affection, friendship, \u201ccharity\u201d (caritas), parental love, and the tensions of these forms of \u201clove\u201d with erotic love. Along with primary texts from the Greek, Jewish, Christian, Islamic, secular troubadour, and Hindu traditions, we will explore the theoretical writings of Martha Nussbaum, Peter Brown, David Halperin, Julia Kristeva, David Biale, Daniel Boyarin, Caroline Walker Bynum, Henry Corbin, Michael Sells, A.K. Ramanujan, Wendy Doniger, David Shulman, and Margaret Trawick. Such a thematic treatment of what we in the English-speaking West call \u201clove\u201d brings to the fore many important theoretical questions concerning the cultural construction of emotions, particular love and \u201cennobling virtues,\u201d the erotic life, the body, and religion.",

Religious communities have often employed secrecy as a strategy for the maintenance of group solidarity and religious identity when faced with allegations of heresy. Secrecy functions not only as a means to subvert and undermine the marginalization of religious minorities but as a powerful tool for the creation of more egalitarian possibilities through preservation of privileged knowledge and the presence of internally shared though externally undisclosed social and religious connections. What kinds of religious secrets are meant to be safeguarded? What set of behaviors and strategies are required to keep these \u201csecrets\u201d or sustain adopted personas? Is religious secrecy merely a tactic for ensuring survival in the context of social marginalization and political persecution? What is the relationship between secrecy and suspicion? Is it necessary that what one wishes to conceal is inherently negative, pernicious or even heretical?",

While serious problems remain, parts of Philadelphia are experiencing a remarkable rebirth and the city has reversed its decades-long trend of population loss. This class will look at the historical development of economic and educational inequality and an effort to address them in South Philadelphia, a largely poor and working-class area undergoing some of the most dramatic social change in the city. For over a century South Philly has been among the city\u2019s most diverse and culturally vibrant areas and a major gateway for immigrants from across the globe-most recently from several Asian countries and the Puebla region of Mexico. The class will travel to South Philly and see the neighborhood in walking tours. The course has a significant community-based learning component in which students will contribute to an on-going project at one of the city\u2019s most diverse public schools: Andrew Jackson Elementary. Jackson\u2019s principal has developed a vision for making the school a model of how a green curriculum can be a low-cost vehicle for under-resourced urban schools to achieve academic excellence. We will help build a rooftop garden where Jackson\u2019s students will learn the science of environmental sustainability by growing their own food. Students will also work to develop the next phase of Jackson becoming a model green school by designing a science greenhouse foe aquaponic and hydroponic vegetable growing systems. Every aspect of this greenhouse will showcase principles of energy efficiency and foster learning of science and math. The goal is to create a classroom that demonstrates daily the potential of passive and active solar energy technologies, allowing Jackson\u2019s students to explore first-hand a critical question: which one is really the expensive \u201calternative\u201d energy source: solar or digging up carbon fuels and burning them?",

    "description": "Over decades millions of workers struggled together, often at great risk and against great odds and repression, to build the U.S. labor movement. In the process they carved out a place of dignity, prosperity, and political voice for workers at the bottom of the economic ladder. They created a path of economic mobility for minorities, women and immigrants. They provided a counterweight for the average citizen against the increasingly concentrated power and influence of modern capitalism\u2019s most fortunate. Because the labor movement empowers the weak it has always been embattled and for decades now it has been in decline. While it contributed some to its own demise, capitalists have systematically attacked the labor movement with a carefully planned and well-funded hegemonic project that has directly challenged it, delegitimized it and legally hamstrung it. The consequences for workers and our society have been terrible. The labor movement is no longer a hedge against economic inequality and over the last several decades an ever-increasing share of the benefits of economic growth go to the top 1% of Americans while wages stagnate or decline for most Americans. Without labor our political discourse is bereft of any meaningful discussion of alternative to the corporate-sponsored neo-liberal ideology of free-markets and deregulation. The traditional avenues of a strong labor movement-the less-educated, immigrants, women, Latinos, and African-Americans-are closing. Soon, if things don\u2019t change, there will be no labor movement to speak of. No other institution in U.S. history has been able to do what the labor movement has done for the average person. What could revitalize it? What, if anything, could replace it? This course will use theories of politics, economics, class and social movements to understand the rise and decline of the labor movement and why it was so critical in determining economic inequality.",

Later, we will focus on the nation building process and the cultural campaigns of turn-of-the-century elites, the causes and consequences of U.S. interventions, the dilemmas of economic development, the rise of state terror, and the lives of transnational migrants today.
